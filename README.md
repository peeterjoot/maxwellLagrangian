# maxwellLagrangian

The intention here is to write a paper describing the geometric algebra (STA) multivector Lagrangian for Maxwell's equation (including fictious magnetic sources.)

All the ideas in question were outlined in a series of blog posts, the final post in that series was:

This paper will be be more coherent and to the point.
